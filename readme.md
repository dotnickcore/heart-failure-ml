# Heart Attack Machine Learning Analysis
## Background
### What is the human heart and what is a heart attack?
The human heart is a powerful pump. A heart attack (myocardial infarction) happens when a blocked coronary artery prevents oxygenated blood from reaching a section of the heart muscle, leading to tissue death.
